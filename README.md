# ChatRoom App
This is a basic ChatRoom project written in Java language, by me, in order to learn socket programming and using Java's multithreading capabilites, along with creating a working minimal graphical user interface with help of Swing API.

## How to run
- Compile both the server and client packages with `javac`.
- Run the server and instances of client with JVM.

## Features
- multiple users can connect to a multi-threaded server which listens for requests using ServerSocket.
- users can join, create and leave rooms, and chat in their current room.
- user-friendly interface created using Swing API, and AWT.
